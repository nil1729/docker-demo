### Introduction to Docker

In this section, you will learn about the basic concepts and components of Docker, including containerization, images, and the Docker ecosystem. It provides a foundation for understanding how Docker works and why it is valuable for modern application development.

### Images & Containers

Understanding Docker images is essential for building and running containers. This section covers topics such as pulling images from Docker Hub, creating custom images using Dockerfiles, and managing images on your local machine.
After getting an understanding of Images, You will learn how to start, stop, restart, and remove containers, as well as how to pass environment variables and map ports between containers and the host system.

### Docker Volumes

Docker volumes allow you to persist data and share it between containers. This section explores how to create and manage volumes, mount them in containers, and back up or restore data stored within volumes.

### Arguments and Environment Variables

Docker provides two essential mechanisms for configuring and customizing container behavior: arguments and environment variables. Using arguments and environment variables in Docker allows for increased flexibility and configuration options. They enable you to customize container behavior without modifying the underlying image.

### Docker Networks

Networking is a critical aspect of Docker, enabling communication between containers and the external world. This section covers container networking modes, port mapping, linking containers, and working with network drivers to customize your network setup.

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications. This section introduces Docker Compose and provides examples to help you understand how to write Compose files to define and run complex applications with multiple services.
